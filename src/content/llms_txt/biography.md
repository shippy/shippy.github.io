## Biography

Lapsed neuroscience researcher (at Yale and SRI) turned AI & data engineer and occasional independent consultant. Working at Waypoint AI as a Lead AI/Data Engineer as of May 2025. Previously worked at Pure Storage (2024) and Nano Energies (2023).

Educational background: Cognitive Science at Yale, International Baccalaureate at Open Gate Boarding School. I got into both because I excelled at tests and debate competitions.

Primary focus: LLM evaluation pipelines, retrieval-augmented generation and MLOps.

Historical focus: building reproducible research/production pipelines with dbt, Python, and whatever else the task required.
