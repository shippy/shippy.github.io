Here's the product of that one time when I wanted to try out `ggplot2` on a controversial dataset about prejudice in the EU, got dragged into an argument about methodology, and ended up learning about `sjPlot`/`sjMisc` and `tmap` in the process of writing a couple thousand words in RMarkdown.

Go read it. It has pretty graphs and ruins your faith in humanity.
