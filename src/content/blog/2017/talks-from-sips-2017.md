The annual meeting of the Society for the Improvement of Psychological Science was amazing! You should see [the OSF conference page](https://osf.io/jtcu9/) if you missed out on it, and you should see the following presentations if you missed out on me:

- [The tidy-data portion of David Condon & I's Preparing and Curating Data for Sharing.](http://simon.podhajsky.net/sips-2017-curation/) (Here's an [OSF page](https://osf.io/p7zv3/) for the whole workshop.)
- [My lightning talk about automated testing of legacy research software](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LvFHVHafyie5NgcQH5rWhk9vQLfnoZW1tcnkqWmvk6U/edit?usp=sharing), featuring my experience of setting up an automated integration test for [PsychTaskFramework](github.com/YaleDecisionNeuro/PsychTaskFramework) with Robot Framework and Sikuli.
