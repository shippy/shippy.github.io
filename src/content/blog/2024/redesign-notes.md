title: "WIP: Research Notes on Personal Website (Re)Design"
description: >
    For my benefit and the benefit of freelancers I'm talking to, I'm writing
    down some notes + examples on what I want (and don't want) in a personal 
    website.

The headings are the primary list, the examples underneath them should just clarify what I mean.

## tl;dr: Current plan of action

- Buy [the Andromeda theme](https://themefisher.com/products/andromeda-astro) and come up with color customizations
- Add a horizontal "rotating" About text with GSAP / Framer Motion / some other framework, and rewrite the copy accordingly
- Bring in the content collections I have

## Things I _don't_ want or need

(so please don't try to upsell me on them)

- CMS integration (`git` is good enough, thank you)
- SEO optimization (I'm the only Šimon Podhajský around and I'm not aiming for search conversions on my blog posts)
- Config-only content determination (I don't intend to re-sell the template, so I don't need to make it super easy to change the content)

## Things I _do_ like

### The horizontal "rotating" About text

- https://ypradhan.com
- https://www.leya.law/

### The scrolling animation (appearance from the bottom) + expansion of background within a single-page app

- https://themefisher.com/products/andromeda-astro  

#### Other examples of engaging scrolling animation

- https://www.gavinoattes.com (but clearly reliant on a lot of content I don't have)
- https://jacobleech.com

### Cleanness

- https://astro-resume04.vercel.app/service/ (although the fact that it _needs_ a loading animation might be a bit much?)
- https://astro.build/themes/details/flaco/ (the photo in the sentence is a fun touch, although maybe not replicable here)
- https://onepagelove.com/coding-bio (very clean, I like that there's only one animation, and it's subtle)
- https://www.ardakaracizmeli.com/ (very attainable)

### Responsive layout (nothing fancy, it should just look fine on a phone)

No particular examples here - I haven't encountered anything that looks / should look particularly fetching on a phone, it just shouldn't break everything.

### Heavily optional: Gradual underline of links 

- e.g. https://quantum.cosmicthemes.com (+ TOC on blogposts inclusion is neat - on that note, the "animation snake" [on this site](https://kld.dev/building-table-of-contents/) is pretty great, too)


## Miscellanea

### Minimalism I'd be tempted with if I was building things myself

- https://astro.build/themes/details/zozo/
- https://astro.build/themes/details/prima-persona/
- https://astro.build/themes/details/astro-multiverse/ (great lightbox for photo gallery)

### Brilliant & beautiful examples (but unattainable on my budget)

- !! https://www.andrejilderda.nl/ - very attainable
-  https://olhauzhykova.com/
-  https://nickstepuk.com/
-  https://www.marchanslin.com/ (though a little too heavily reliant on slow/stable scroll speed)
-  https://rafa.design/ - video integrating into the page + "people I'd like to meet"
-  https://onepagelove.com/helena-zhang / https://www.helenazhang.com/ - color on hover
-  https://starklysaid.com/ - copywriting expansion on hover
-  https://charliepite.com - engaging use of video (although it's really the idea that sells it)
