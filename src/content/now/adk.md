Debate is historically quite meaningful to me. Improving reasoning is the first step towards truth-seeking, and debate is a great way to do that. (Though of course these days, I'm also very curious about the latest fads.)

Other than a garden-variety judge, I've been a member of the Competition Committee and a Board member of the main Czech debate organization (Asociace debatních klubů) since 2023. This means that I spend a lot of time thinking about the direction the organization and its didactics should take. Fun stuff.
