I've always liked the genre of hyper-specific music that narrowly apply to a given situation. With the advent of AI song generators like [Suno.ai](https://suno.com/), I've been sinning against my ears with the most specific songs I can think of. So I have

- A dance song about the way my girlfriend orders too many liquids at a caf√©, and
- A Broadway ballad about yak shaving, or
- A rock song about using Terraform for everything.

I'm intentionally not linking to these songs, because they're terrible. But they're my terrible songs, and I love them.
