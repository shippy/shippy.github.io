I'm attempting to apply the known best practices from software engineering and data engineering to LLM-based apps. Testing, CI/CD, monitoring, observability, and more.

I do this at [my current full-time job](https://www.linkedin.com/in/simonpodhajsky). I use side projects to test out new ways. I share my learnings in presentations and blog posts. I'm this close to dreaming about it at night.
