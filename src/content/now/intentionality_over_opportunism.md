title: Intentionality over Opportunism

With dawning horror, I recently came to a realization that I've become really good at opportunism. I've been optimizing towards the local maximum, and I've been doing it for so long that I've forgotten what the global maximum even looks like.

On the one hand, this is very zen and functional, and it's not like there isn't a skill to it. On the other hand, I kinda miss planning for a much better future; I miss working towards something that isn't just the next step on the ladder.
