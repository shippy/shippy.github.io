I follow [the 80,000 Hours guidelines](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/job-satisfaction/) in my job search. This means that my dream job would have three main characteristics:

1. **High impact.** I want to work on something that matters: it has at least the potential to improve the world and positively affect the lives of many.
2. **Learning opportunities.** I want to grow as a professional. This can mean either new skills, new domain, or new responsibilities.
3. **Good working conditions.** I want to work in an environment that is supportive, respectful, and inclusive; I love a team that values open communication, feedback, and collaboration; and I expect to be paid fairly for my work.

Finally - and perhaps this goes without saying - I need to be **a good fit** for the job as well. [You can get a good idea of what fits me on my About page](/about) - generally speaking, **I thrive at the intersection of data and LLMs**.

- If you have a dream job that fits these criteria, please reach out right away!
- If your job fits _some_ but not all, I'm still happy to hear about it, but less likely to leave my current position over it.
- If your job doesn't fit _any_ of these criteria, I'm probably not the right person for it.
