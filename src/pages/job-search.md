I follow [the 80,000 Hours guidelines](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/job-satisfaction/) in my job search. This means that my ideal job would have three main characteristics:

1. **High impact.** I want to work on something that matters: it has at least the potential to improve the world and positively affect the lives of many.
2. **Learning opportunities.** I want to grow as a professional. This can mean either new skills, new domain, or new responsibilities.
3. **Good working conditions.** I want to work in an environment that is supportive, respectful, and inclusive; I love a team that values open communication, feedback, and collaboration; and I expect to be paid fairly for my work.

Finally - and perhaps this goes without saying - I need to be **a good fit** for the job as well. [You can get a good idea of what fits me on my About page](/about).

If you have a job that fits these criteria, please reach out on LinkedIn or via e-mail. I'm always happy to chat about potential opportunities.
